This is a [QOTD server](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc865), it is pretty
full featured.

> You can get *anywhere* in ten minutes if you drive fast enough.

There's also a sister project, [QOTD
Client](https://github.com/nixterrimus/qotd-client).  While netcat works
good for testing the client is more full featured.

## Try it out

- Install the server: `go get -u github.com/nixterrimus/qotd-server`
- Start the server: `qotd-server https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nixterrimus/qotd-server/master/wisdom.txt`
- In another terminal make a request: `nc localhost 3333`

## Specifying a File

The QOTD server needs a path to a file or an HTTP URL that contains
quotes, this argument is mandatory and should specified as the first
argument.  Here are some examples:

- `qotd-server funny.txt`
- `qotd-server`
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nixterrimus/qotd-server/master/wisdom.txt

## Quote File Format

This QOTD server has a mandatory files argument of a quote file, for
example to run with the `wisdom.txt` file included in the git repository
you would use: `qotd-server wisdom.txt`.

The quote file format is exactly the same as the [fortune file
format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)#Fortune_files), that
is to say:

- It is a text file
- Each quote is separated by a `%` character of its own line

## The QOTD Protocol / RFC 865

RFC 865 defines the [Quote of the Day
Protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc865). The specification is
really short.  Here's the gist of it:

- The Server listens on TCP (port 17, by convention)
- The Server may also listen on UDP (also port 17, by convention)
- On connection a quote is served
- The connection is closed immediately after a quote is serve
- Quotes should be less than 512 characters long

This server **can** be started RFC 865 compliant mode with the
`--strict` flag.

## Strict Mode

This QOTD server can be started in strict mode, it must be run as a super
user because it binds to port 17.  This ensures that the server is RFC
865 compliant.

Strict mode does the following things:

- Starts on port 17
- Listens on both TCP and UDP
- Serves quotes that are 512 characters or less

## TCP and UDP

By default the server listens on both TCP and UDP on the same port.  If
that doesn't fit your needs, you have a couple of flags:

- `no-tcp` - Starts the server and only listens on UDP
- `no-udp` - Starts the server and only listens on TCP

You can test the TCP interface with netcat: `nc localhost 3333` And you can test on UDP
as well: `echo -n " " | nc -4u -w1 localhost 3333`.

## Interface

By default `0.0.0.0` but not forever.

## Service Discovery

The QOTD service is, by default advertised over
[MDNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS).  This makes it
possible for clients to find the server with zero config, pretty neat!

If that doesn't work for you, can specify `--no-mdns` to turn off
advertising the service.

Since some networks restrict publishing multicast DNS it's possible that
this feature just won't work on your network.  . Notably, multicast cannot be used 
in any sort of cloud, or shared infrastructure environment.

## Next Steps / Project Goals

- [X] Accept file as CLI argument
- [ ] Accept Quotes via Standard In
- [X] Accept a URL for a quote file
- [X] Accept port as CLI argument
- [X] Server should run in 865 compliant or non-compliant mode (512
character truncation)
- [X] Server should listen on UDP
- [ ] Server should be well tested
- [ ] Installable through homebrew
- [ ] Advertise QOTD over MDNS
- [ ] Never serve clients the same quote twice
